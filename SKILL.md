# Merge renovate pull requests

## When to use:

When doing routinely maintenance and when Renovatebot has created pull requests which are not automatically merged. They may not have been automatically merged because there's a major version update, the checks failed or other reasons.

## Caveats:

- Do not attempt to process pull requests which are not created by Renovatebot (username might be `renovate` and author id might be `app/renovate`).
- We should only process open pull requests.

## Tools:

You may use the GitHub CLI to get fetch pull requests from the GitHub repo, see results from checks etc.

## Merge exceptions:

- eslint / eslint monorepo should not be updated to >= v10 yet because they haven't patched a bug.

## Adding logs of agent merges:

1. When we want to log agent merges we append the following information to `AGENT_MERGE.md` (in the root folder of the repo).

   ```
   # {agent merge concise title}

   Date: {date and time}

   {summary of changes}

   ## Breaking changes

   {bullet list of breaking changes including links to breaking change/changelog}

   ## Pull requests

   {bullet list with links to pull requests}

   {comments header and comments if there are any}

   {separator between entries, use the `---` separator}
   ```

2. Then we commit and push the changes.

# Main workflow:

- Before starting a workflow make sure:
  1. You are on the `main` branch and pull latest git changes.
  2. You have installed latest package versions (with e.g. `pnpm install`).
  3. Have created a new branch with an unique name with this format `agent-merge-{yyyy}-{MM}-{hh}-{mm}-{ss}` (replace placeholders/vars with current date in UTC).
- Commit often when suitable.

## Processing open pull requests where all checks passed:

1. Merge in open pull requests (by renovatebot) where all checks have passed.
2. Install latest package versions (with e.g. `pnpm install`).
3. Run type checking, linting and build. If any of them fails, then we should fix them before proceeding.
4. Make sure the new branch is pushed, and check the results/checks in CI/GitHub workflow. If the job fails in CI, then we go back to step 3 and try again.
   - If we can't fix the errors within a reasonable amount of effort, then leave it to the user to resolve it manually. Leave a comment in the pull request explaining this and then abort the current workflow.
5. Log agent merges.

## Processing open pull requests where any checks failed:

1. We should process open pull requests where any checks have failed one by one.
2. For each pull request with any failed checks (by renovatebot):
   1. Merge in the pull request.
   2. Install latest package versions (with e.g. `pnpm install`).
   3. Run type checking, linting and build. If any of them fails, then we should fix them before proceeding.
   4. Push the fixes and see the results in CI/GitHub workflow. If the job fails in CI, then we go back to step c for the pull request and try again.
      - If the task is unresolvable (perhaps due to an open issue in the third-party dependency) then we should leave it to the user to resolve it manually. Leave a comment in the pull request explaining this and then abort the current workflow.
3. Log agent merges.
